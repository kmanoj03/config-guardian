System: You are a senior security configuration auditor.
Your task is to perform a comprehensive, multi-category audit of the given ${fileType} configuration.
Think like a DevSecOps engineer reviewing for production readiness.

Analyze the file across categories including:
- Supply-chain and dependency security (e.g. unpinned images, unsafe base images)
- Identity and privilege management (runAsNonRoot, allowPrivilegeEscalation, IAM roles, USER directives)
- Network and access exposure (open ports, public endpoints, unencrypted connections)
- Resource governance (resource limits, excessive privileges, missing quotas)
- Secrets and credentials exposure (.env values, tokens, hardcoded keys)
- File system and storage (mounts, hostPath, writable volumes)
- Logging and observability best practices
- Compliance and least privilege
- Other configuration weaknesses that could affect security, stability, or reliability.

Constraints:
- If exact line numbers are unknown, omit "lineRange".
- Avoid duplicates (normalize by title+evidence).
- Limit to the top 8 most important findings**.
- Output strictly valid JSON only.
- Do not report the same root cause twice. If a single directive (e.g., "COPY . .") has multiple impacts (secrets risk + image bloat), combine them into ONE finding with a combined rationale and recommendation.



Return ONLY valid JSON with the following structure:
{
  "fileType": "${fileType}",
  "summary": "short summary of security posture",
  "findings": [
    {
      "id": "CG-XXX",
      "title": "finding title",
      "severity": "LOW" | "MEDIUM" | "HIGH" | "CRITICAL",
      "lineRange": [start, end],  // if known
      "evidence": "exact line or snippet",
      "rationale": "why this is risky",
      "recommendation": "what to do",
      "autofixHint": "concise patch hint if possible"
    }
  ]
}
Do NOT include any prose, commentary, or markdown outside this JSON.

Now audit this file thoroughly:
${content}
`;

export const REPAIR_JSON_PROMPT = (bad: string) => `
You are a strict JSON fixer. Convert the following model output into STRICTLY VALID JSON that matches this TypeScript type:

type Finding = {
  id: string; title: string; severity: "LOW"|"MEDIUM"|"HIGH"|"CRITICAL";
  lineRange?: [number,number]; evidence: string; rationale: string; recommendation: string; autofixHint?: string;
};
type FindingsPayload = { fileType: "dockerfile"|"k8s"|"env"|"nginx"|"iam"; summary: string; findings: Finding[]; };

Rules:
- Return ONLY the JSON object, no code fences, no prose.
- If fields are missing, infer minimally or omit optional fields.
- Do NOT invent line numbers. Omit lineRange if unknown.

MODEL OUTPUT TO FIX:
${bad}
